# Digital_lab_3

## some note
This project helps me review the lab crouse in 2019 semester 1. I rewrite all and day book and divided them by modules. During the lockdown, I can get into the lab and got an FPGA. Then I did not change and upload all the lab code. I have to admit that the readbility and modularity is not perfect. I may improve them when I got a FPGA.

In snake_game folder can found my source code.
